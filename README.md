# Automatic Sanitization Line-Following Robot

## Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining hygiene and minimizing human contact became critical to reducing the spread of the virus. This project aims to automate the sanitization process using a line-following robot that dispenses sanitizer while moving along a predefined path.

## Objective
The robot is designed to:
1. Follow a line using IR sensors.
2. Continuously sanitize the surrounding area.
3. Reduce the need for manual sanitization.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensors
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Servo Motor/Pump
- Chassis
- Battery
- Sanitizer Dispenser

## Working Principle
The robot uses IR sensors to detect a line and adjusts its movement accordingly. A sanitizer sprayer, controlled by a servo motor or pump, is activated as soon as the robot starts moving and stops when the robot stops.

## Future Enhancements
1. Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.
2. Remote control via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
3. Advanced sanitization methods like UV-C light.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of robotics and automation in addressing real-world problems and improving public health.
